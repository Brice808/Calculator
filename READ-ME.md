This is an project on python 3 realized during an Epitech course : Coding Academy.
This scientific calculator has two modes: standard and scientific.
To switch between those two modes just select the one you want in "file".

I put it in orange to brighten your computer during this pandemic :D

To launch the project just run : python3 calculator_2.py
